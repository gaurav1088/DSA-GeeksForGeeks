 # DSA-GeeksForGeeks
This repository contains my DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) practice solutions from GeeksforGeeks. It includes a variety of problems covering arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more.

Each solution is written in Java with detailed comments for better understanding. The goal is to improve problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews.


ðŸ”¹Features:

âœ… Well-structured Java, c++ solutions with explanations
âœ… Efficient algorithms using optimized approaches
âœ… Regular updates with new problem solutions
âœ… Useful for coding interviews & competitive programming.
